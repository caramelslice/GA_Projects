Footnotes:
"1. Data for in situ Breast Cancers are listed separately from Breast Cancers and not included in the ""all sites"" category."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites or by Childhood Cancer, because aggregate"
"values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be"
"misleading."
"2. These states are missing data for the indicated year: Alabama 1999; Arkansas 1999-2000, 2002; District of Columbia 2001-2002;"
"Maryland 2001; Mississippi 1999-2002; Nevada 1999, 2011; North Dakota 2001; South Dakota 1999-2000; Tennessee 1999-2003;"

"3. Data are suppressed if fewer than 16 cases are reported in the specific category. Data for the ""Asian / Pacific Islander"","

"ethnicity groups: 1) American Indian or Alaska Native data are suppressed at the state level for Delaware, Georgia, Illinois,"
"Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, and South Carolina; 2) Asian or Pacific Islander data are suppressed at the"

"level for Delaware, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancer-v2011.html#Confidentiality."
"4. Data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet data quality criteria."
"5. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and"
"Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for"
"these states, nor are these counts included in the summary populations for the affected division, regions or national"
"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005."
"6. Information on primary site, behavior, and histology was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for"
"Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) and categorized according to the revised SEER recodes dated January 27, 2003, which define"
"standard groupings of primary cancer sites."
